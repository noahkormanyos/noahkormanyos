									<h1>My Experience</h1>

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/tie_pic.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
								<p>Filing for an LLC at age 19 and spending my entire undergraduate career tutoring and mentoring students has allowed me to develop valuable leadership experience that I'm eager to implement in a professional environment.</p>
								<p>In December of 2018, I made the decision to file for an LLC and create my first business. The following months provided me with many challenges, and many valuable learning experiences. From creating a professional business card to conducting marketing meetings with the executives of local businesses, the first few months of my business proved to be a steep learning curve. In retrospect, these challenges ultimately taught me more about business acumen and professionalism than I've ever learned in a formal educational setting. As my self-confidence grew, so did my desire to help more people improve their lives, and their businesses.</p>
								<p>Since creating my business in 2018, I've largely focused my energy and attention towards helping my fellow classmates throughout their academic journey. Over the past couple years I've tutored over 300 undergraduate students through Clarkson University's Student Success Center. In addition to my work at Clarkson, I've also worked with over 50 highschool and college students through personal tutoring sessions. One of the most important skills I've developed from these experiences has been the ability to describe my knowledge of a subject in multiple ways, allowing students with different learing styles to cohesively understand a common topic. Most importantly, these tutoring and mentorship experiences have taught me to trust and leverage my leadership abilities.</p>
								<p>I believe in the importance of leadership and adaptibility when tackling difficult problems. When teams and groups are able to leverage the strengths of each member, large problems begin to dissolve. My understanding and experience of these topics will allow me to have an immediate impact in a professional setting. If you believe I posess the skills and experience to bring impact to your company, please reach out via email or linked in. Thank you for your time.</p>
